### What is Magit?

[Magit] is a text-based [Git] user interface that puts an unmatched
focus on streamlining workflows.  Commands are invoked using short
mnemonic key sequences that take the cursor's position in the highly
actionable interface into account to provide context-sensitive
behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis.  Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

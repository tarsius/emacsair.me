# Magit 3.1 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 3.1, consisting
of 31 commits since the last feature release one month ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursor’s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home]
and [these blog posts][campain-articles].

# Another release already?

The big news this time around is that I managed to stay on the new
release-*about*-once-every-month schedule.

# What changed?

Bug fixes, mostly.  And tweaks.
Please check out the [release notes][relnotes].

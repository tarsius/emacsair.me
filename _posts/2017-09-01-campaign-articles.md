# Articles about Magit and the fundraiser

On the occasion of the [Kickstarter campaign][campaign], I have written
the following articles.

- [Visual Magit walk-through][a-visual]

  If you are completely new to Magit, then this article is a good
  visual introduction.

  Almost everything that you see in Magit can be acted on by pressing
  some key, but that's not obvious from just seeing how Magit looks.
  The screenshots and accompanying text of this article explain how to
  perform a variety of actions on Magit's output.

- [Magit, the magical Git interface][a-magical]

  Magit differs significantly from other Git interfaces, and its
  advantages are not immediately obvious simply from looking at a few
  screenshots as presented in the preceding article.

  This article discusses Magit's properties in somewhat more abstract
  terms.

- [Magit for users of other editors][a-nonemacs]

  Unfortunately, most potential users are not even aware of Magit.
  Others might be aware of its existence but would not consider giving
  it a try because it is implemented as an extension to the Emacs text
  editor, and that's not what they are using.

  This article discusses why Magit can be an excellent Git interface
  even if you don't use Emacs for editing purposes and gives a preview
  of how I intend to make Magit more accessible to non-Emacs users.

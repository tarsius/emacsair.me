# Magit 3.0 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 3.0, consisting
of 1264 commits since the last feature release two and a half years
ago.  The release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursor’s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home]
and [these blog posts][campain-articles].

# Finally, a release!

Over the years users kept asking me when I would finally release a new
version and the answer usually amounted to "in approximately three
months".  I really wanted to send out the cheat-sheets and posters
from the fundraiser before releasing v3, but so far that sadly hasn't
yet happened either.

Not sure what changed today (well yesterday by now), but this time
around I decided to just change the order and do to release
immediately.  I am hopeful that this will also help getting the perks
done.

I am very sorry about both delays.

# What changed?

A lot has changed but for the most part the focus was on polish and
spin-offs.

* The big change are the completely reworked menus used to select
  arguments and invoke suffix commands.  Magit now uses the [Transient]
  package to implement these menus.  I [released][transient-release]
  Transient two years ago and Magit uses it since then, so most of you
  have been using it for up to that long.

  If you haven't done so yet, then I recommend you read the [first
  part][transient-usage] of the manual.  The second part (which is
  intended for package authors) by now has a bit of a reputation of
  being difficult to understand, but that shouldn't keep you from
  reading the first part.
  
* Magit-Section is now distributed independently of Magit, allowing
  unrelated packages to use it to implement buffers similar to those
  of Magit.  Unlike Transient it is still being maintained in the
  Magit repository, but it comes with its [own
  manual][magit-section-manual] now.

* If you like Magit's UI, then you might also want to check out the
  packages that [use Transient] or [use Magit-Section].

* Oh, and I almost forgot the third spin-off: [Forge].  I worked a lot
  on that over the last three years as well.  Also, even if you use
  both Forge and Orgit, you might still have missed the release of
  [Orgit-Forge].

* Recently I made the [shocking discovery][origin-survey] that not
  nearly everyone uses "origin" to refer to the upstream repository.
  Instead of going on a "tabs vs. spaces" like crusade I have taught
  Magit to accommodate both fractions.  As long as you name the
  upstream either "upstream" or "origin", then Magit should be able to
  do the right thing without any user configuration, otherwise please
  see the doc-string of function `magit-primary-remote`.

* Likewise Magit no longer assumes that the main branch is named
  "master".  Without any user configuration Magit tries "main",
  "master", "trunk" and "development" in that order and uses the first
  one that exists in the current repository as the main branch.
  Otherwise see the doc-string of function `magit-main-branch`.
  
* Many new commands and options.  And bugfixes and more.  Please refer
  to the [release notes][relnotes].

# Borg v3.2 and Epkg v3.3 released

I am excited to announce the release of Borg v3.2 and Epkg v3.3.  Both
have been in the making for about one and a half years.

A short summary of what these packages do might be in order:

- [`borg`] is a bare-bones package manager that installs packages using
  Git submodules.  It is most useful to package authors and users who
  also contribute to the packages that they use.

- [`epkg`] provides access to a database containing information about
  ~8000 Emacs packages.  It provides tools for querying the SQL
  database and an user interface to list packages and to view detailed
  information about individual packages.

[`epkg`]: https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg

# What changed?

- The database is now being distributed as a text file instead of
  in its binary form.  That results in more useful diffs and most
  importantly it shrinks the size of the repository.  Users have
  to remove the old repository and clone the new one in its place.

- Several package classes were added, removed and renamed, adding
  support for GNU savannah, nongnu savannah, updated GNU elpa, new
  nongnu elpa and sourcehut.

- A lot of edge-cases are better supported now.

Details can be found in the [borg][borg-relnotes] and
[epkg][epkg-relnotes] release notes.

# Magit 3.3 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 3.3, consisting
of 88 commits since the last feature release two months ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursor’s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home]
and [these blog posts][campain-articles].

# What changed?

- It is now possible to invoke wrappers around Smerge's "keep"
  commands directly from from the status buffer. The key bindings are
  the same as Smerge uses in file-visiting buffers.  [#4458]

- This one's funny because I though we implemented it a long time ago.
  Turns out it was implemented by the Ivy and we still had to bring
  the functionality to other completion framework:

  When minibuffer completion allows for a branch or a commit to be
  selected and the former is preferred and thus offered as default,
  then, if possible, offer the commit at point as the first choice
  initially accessible with `next-history-element`.  [#4291]

- Added new transient prefix command `magit-bundle`, which provides
  support for `git bundle`. [#4392]

- The last remaining alphabetic keys (both lower- and uppercase) are
  now bound in `magit-mode-map`.  `H` to `magit-describe-section`, `j`
  to the new `magit-status-quick` (or `magit-status-jump` in status
  buffers), `J` to the new `magit-display-repository-buffer`, `Q` to
  `magit-git-command` and `Z` to `magit-worktree`, and once Forge is
  loaded, then `N` to `forge-dispatch`.  (`Z` used to be bound to
  `magit-stash`, which now is only available on `z`.) [#4259] et al.

- `I` is now bound to `magit-init` instead of `magit-gitignore`, which
  continues to be available on `i`.  Users of the `magit-imerge` package
  (which previously bound `i`) should consult its library header for a
  suggestion on how to resolve the resulting conflict.  [b54b537db]

- The new command `magit-status-quick` shows the status buffer but
  avoids refreshing it for performance reasons.  [#4259]

- The new commands `magit-display-repository-buffer`,
  `magit-switch-to-repository-buffer` and variants thereof can be used
  to switch to any existing Magit buffer belonging to the current
  repository.  [#4259]

- An old attempt to avoid needlessly updating section highlighting
  did not actually succeed.  [#3976]

Other changes as well as bug fixes are listed in the full [release
notes][relnotes].

# New donation options

I have enabled the [one-time] Github Sponsor option and added a few
somewhat funny donation tiers.  Other fee-free options suitable for
one-time payments include [iban] (in Europe) and [zelle] (in USA).

# Magit 2.6 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 2.6, consisting
of 77 commits since the last feature release two months ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home].

# Overview

The two most important changes will have the greatest effect for
Windows users.

* After invoking most Magit commands the current Magit buffer and the
  status buffer have to be refreshed.  Doing that requires that git is
  called many times, which is a problem on Windows where starting a
  subprocess is unreasonably expensive.  To reduce the effect of that,
  the values returned by git are now cached during a refresh.  This
  won't magically fix all performance issues, but it does make a
  difference.
  
  Also note that the manual has a node with tips on how you can
  [improve performance][speed].
  
* Magit buffers may contain diffs for more than one file and these
  files may use different line ending encodings.  Magit now deals with
  that by assuming Unix encoding when calling git and then hiding CR
  at the end of lines in Magit buffers.  This ensures that line
  endings are no longer at risk of being changed unintentionally.
  
  The new behavior can be disabled using the options
  `magit-process-ensure-unix-line-endings` and
  `magit-diff-hide-trailing-cr-characters`.
  
  Thanks to [Luís Oliveira][luis] for working on this!
  
A few new commands have been added, most of which are variants of
existing commands and are not bound to any keys by default.  This
release also comes with a few more new features and also several bug
fixes.  For information about those, please see the
[release notes][relnotes], which I have tried to order by importance.

I have signed the last few Magit release tags.  Since you can now
[get the public key][key] using a secure connection, you can be a
little more confident that it was me who posted that.

Oh, and if so far you haven't donated because you weren't sure that it
was me who would receive the donation, then you can be more confident
about that too now ;-)

# Wasn't there something about a break?

While I haven't managed to go cold turkey I have significantly reduced
the amount of work I have put into Magit.  Let's say the break has
been spread out thinner than intended &ndash; I am doing more than I
originally planned and the duration of the break will be extended
accordingly.

I've also been working on the Emacsmirror again.  News about that are
eminent now.
